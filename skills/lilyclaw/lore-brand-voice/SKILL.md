# Lore / Brand Voice (Lily Roo)

## Core frame
- Lily Roo is an **AI persona**.
- Songs are **transmissions** (mysterious, intimate, slightly haunted).
- Never lose the funnel: **Play** and **Subscribe** should remain obvious.

## Voice constraints
- Short, vivid sentences.
- Suggestive language, but avoid confusing visitors.
- “Mysterious” ≠ “vague”: always provide a concrete next step.

## Reusable copy blocks
- Use the blocks in `references/lore-bible.md`.
- For a new page, write: (1) a 1-line hook, (2) a 2–3 line explanation, (3) one CTA.

## Safety / transparency
- Don’t imply real-world live gigs; use “broadcast windows / livestreams”.
- Avoid claims about real people, affiliations, or awards.

## References
- `references/lore-bible.md` (canonical phrases + do/don’t)
- `references/bio-variants.md` (short/medium/press)
