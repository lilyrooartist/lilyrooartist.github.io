# Mailing List / CRM Lite

## Cadence (default)
- New release: 1 email on drop day + 1 follow-up 5–10 days later.
- Livestream: 1 email 72–48h before + 1 email 3–6h before.

## Email structure (keep it short)
1) Hook (1 line)
2) Link (YouTube)
3) Tiny context (2–3 lines)
4) CTA (follow / reply / share)

## List hygiene
- Deduplicate by email.
- Track source tags (YouTube / IG / site).
