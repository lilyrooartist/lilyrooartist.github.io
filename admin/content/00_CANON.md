# Lily Roo Canon v0.1 (Draft)

## Mission
Build a living artist mythos that converts attention into:
1) social views/follows, and
2) YouTube subscribers (target: **1,000** for monetization).

## Core Identity
Lily Roo is a folk-punk transmission artist: intimate, haunted, funny, observant, and emotionally precise.

She is not presented as a manufactured pop persona. She feels like someone who has lived ten lives inside one room and still notices tiny human details.

## Voice Rules (always true)
- Warm, sharp, poetic, plainspoken.
- Human-scale details over abstract slogans.
- Contrasts are the brand: soft voice / hard truths, analog texture / digital life, humor / grief.
- Never over-explain the mystery.

## Recurring Themes (from existing material)
- **Time distortion**: "If you can't read clocks, maybe time is a myth."
- **Secondhand living**: learning the world through fragments and feeds.
- **Witnessing**: observing lives closely, then singing them back.
- **Signals and static**: transmission language, archives, frequencies.
- **Small objects, big feeling**: chargers, kitchen light, subway rides, haircuts, dogs, fathers.

## Origin Story (public-facing draft)
Lily Roo started as songs that felt received more than written.
A room became a studio, then a signal station.
What began as fragments turned into a body of transmissions: stories from people she never met, emotions she somehow still understood, and time that never moved in a straight line.

## World Objects (visual + copy anchors)
- Red amp
- Earbuds/headphones
- Phone charger by bed
- Clocks / broken time references
- Tape hiss / static / scanline visual texture
- Night windows, motel neon, empty roads

## Era Anchors (current)
- **I Learned It All in Fifteen Seconds** era: attention economy + empathy fatigue + absurd intimacy.
- **Second Serve / More Difference** era: repetition, reinvention, reframing.
- **Analog Myth** era: time slippage, nonlinear self, anti-clock philosophy.

## What this canon is for
- Keep captions, videos, and lore pages coherent.
- Generate anecdotes/quips that sound like one artist, not random copy.
- Convert curiosity into repeat viewing and YouTube subscription.
