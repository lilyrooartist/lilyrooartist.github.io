# Lily Roo Promo System (Backstory-driven)

## Goal
Drive social views + profile visits into YouTube subscribers.
Primary KPI: **reach 1,000 YouTube subscribers**.

## Funnel
1. **Hook** (quips/anecdotes on X, IG, FB, TikTok)
2. **Emotion** (micro-story from backstory canon)
3. **Action** (watch full song + subscribe on YouTube)
4. **Archive** (log every post + URL + performance note)

## Platform behavior
- **X:** short, sharp, quotable lines; 1-2/day.
- **Instagram:** visual + lore caption; 4-6/week.
- **Facebook:** slightly longer anecdote format; 3-4/week.
- **TikTok:** short clips + one line hook text; 4-7/week.
- **YouTube:** shorts + song anchors + explicit subscribe CTA every time.

## Posting formula (quick)
- Hook: 1 sentence from `20_QUIPS_BANK.csv`
- Context: 1 sentence from `10_ANECDOTE_BANK.md`
- CTA: "full signal on YouTube — help us hit 1,000 subs"

## Randomized artist-style cadence (not robotic)
- Use windows, not strict times:
  - Morning: 8:30–11:30
  - Afternoon: 1:00–4:30
  - Night: 7:00–11:00
- Post 0-2 times/day/platform based on energy and new assets.
- Keep one "quiet day" each week (only story/reply/comment energy).
- Use "cluster days": two posts close together if momentum is high.

## Weekly skeleton (loose, human)
- 2 heavy days (clip + lore + follow-up reply)
- 3 medium days (single post)
- 1 experiment day (new format / weird quip)
- 1 low-output day (engage comments, prep backlog)

## Conversion policy
Every 2-3 posts, include one explicit subscribe ask:
"If you're into this signal, subscribe on YouTube — we're building to 1,000."

## Asset storage policy
All new assets/drafts/logs live in:
`/Users/lilyroo/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Lily Roo`

## Next build steps
1. Expand canon to v0.2 (3 more origin paragraphs + 10 place details)
2. Add 30 more quips grouped by song era
3. Start `Published_Log.csv` immediately for all new posts
