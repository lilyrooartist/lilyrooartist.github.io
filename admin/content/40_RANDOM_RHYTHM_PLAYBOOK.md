# Random Rhythm Playbook ("real artist" mode)

Use this so posting feels alive, not scheduled by a robot.

## Dice method (daily)
Roll or pick a number 1-6:
1 = no post, only comments/replies
2 = one short quip post
3 = one anecdote post
4 = one clip + one follow-up reply
5 = two posts (different tones)
6 = one post + one behind-the-scenes fragment

## Tone rotation wheel
- Observational
- Wry / darkly funny
- Intimate confession
- Mythic / signal mode
- Direct CTA mode

Do not use the same tone more than 2 days in a row.

## CTA frequency
- Soft CTA most days
- Hard YouTube subscribe CTA every 3rd post

## Anti-formula guardrails
- Leave some posts without hashtags.
- Occasionally post a one-liner with no explanation.
- Sometimes post at odd times (late night / midday lull).
- Not every post should mention "new song".

## Monthly narrative arc
Week 1: Introduce mood/world
Week 2: Deepen contradictions + anecdotes
Week 3: Push strongest song clips + subscriber asks
Week 4: Reflective/behind-the-song + reset
