# Anecdote Bank v0.1

Use these as seeds for captions, spoken intros, shorts hooks, pinned comments, and interview-style posts.

## A-series: Time / Analog Myth
- **LR-ANEC-001**: I stopped wearing a watch because it kept lying to me before I learned clocks don't measure feeling.
- **LR-ANEC-002**: Analog Myth started when I missed three appointments in one day and still somehow made the right song on time.
- **LR-ANEC-003**: The first lyric was written after staring at a microwave clock blinking 12:00 like it was an apology.
- **LR-ANEC-004**: If time is linear, why do old hurts show up with better lighting at 2am?

## F-series: Fifteen Seconds / Feed Life
- **LR-ANEC-005**: I wrote "I Learned It All in Fifteen Seconds" after realizing I knew a stranger's grief before I knew my neighbor's name.
- **LR-ANEC-006**: The line about the charger by my bed is true. It's the modern candle.
- **LR-ANEC-007**: I cried at a clip of a soldier coming home and then forgot my own grocery list. That's the whole song.
- **LR-ANEC-008**: "I've lived a thousand lives alone" came from one scroll session that felt like a year.

## S-series: Signal / Lore
- **LR-ANEC-009**: I call songs "transmissions" because they arrive like weather, not like tasks.
- **LR-ANEC-010**: The archive is the map; each track is a coordinate, not just a release.
- **LR-ANEC-011**: Every song starts with one honest object: a charger, a cup, a receipt, a missed call.
- **LR-ANEC-012**: I don't chase trends; I chase moments that survive after the trend is gone.

## R-series: Second Serve / More Difference
- **LR-ANEC-013**: Second Serve is what happens when life says "again" and you answer "better posture this time."
- **LR-ANEC-014**: More Difference came from trying to explain a tiny hurt that changed everything.
- **LR-ANEC-015**: Repetition isn't failure; it's how some truths become audible.

## P-series: Place / Persona
- **LR-ANEC-016**: The room got smaller when the songs got bigger.
- **LR-ANEC-017**: Folk punk for me is kindness with cracked knuckles.
- **LR-ANEC-018**: I trust songs that sound like they walked home alone.
