Second Serve — lyrics (from YouTube description)
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nxa0D-gqns

Verse 1
Didn’t stretch, didn’t warm up much
Held the racket like a coffee cup
Coach said try to find your spell
Just breathe and swing and hope it fell

Verse 2
Underhand serve, yeah that’s my call
Not fast, not tricky — but it beats them all
They swing too wild or let it go
I win the point just keeping it low

Verse 3
School van hums as we head out
No one cheers, but we don’t doubt
Somewhere out there, we pretend to hear
A quiet roar from Brooks the Bear

Chorus
Mostly we walk around picking up balls
Crocs squeak loud in the quiet of it all
No crowd, no stats on a wall
Just one more serve, Crocs and all

Verse 4
Coach says I’m the most chill on the team
Even when it’s match point, I don’t scream
I just stand there, take my time
Hit it in and everything’s fine

Final Chorus
Mostly we walk around picking up balls
Lose track of score, forget who falls
I’m not great — but I don’t stall
Second serve, Crocs and all

Outro
Parents wait in the lot, quiet and kind
Wave as we wander off the backline
It’s not for glory, not for a call
We just keep showing up — Crocs and all
